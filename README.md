# flickr-uploader
----------------
by oPromessa, 2017, V2.6.4

## IMPORTANT NOTE: (MOST OF THE WORK DONE). MORE IN PROGRESS...
* Updated to use sybrenstuvel's flickrapi and OAuth...
* V2.6.3 would be good for use and testing.

## Description
--------------
* flickr-uploader designed for Synology Devices.
* Upload a directory of media to Flickr to use as a backup to your
local storage.
* Check Features, Requirements and Setup remarks.

## Features
-----------
* Uploads both images and movies (JPG, PNG, GIF, AVI, MOV, 3GP files)
   * Personnaly I avoid PNG files which do not support EXIF info
* Multiple loadings in parallel is available (check -p option)
* Stores image information locally using a simple SQLite database
* Creates "Sets" based on the folder name the media is in
  (getting existing sets from Flickr is managed also)
* Ignores unwanted directories (like ".picasabackup" for Picasa users or
  "@eaDir" for Synology NAS users) and you can easily add/configure more
  yourself. Check uploadr.ini config file.
* Allows specific files to be ignored (via regular expressions)
* Skips files that are over a configurable size (max flickr size is about 900MB)
* Reuploads modified images
* Automatically removes images from Flickr when they are removed from your
  local hard drive
* Convert RAW files (with an external tool). Check Known issues section.

IF YOU FIND A BUG, PLEASE REPORT IT.

## Requirements
---------------
* Python 2.7+ (should work on DSM from Synology (v6.1), Windows and MAC)
* flicrkapi module. May need to install get-pip.py. (Instructions for
  Synology DSM below.)
* File write access (for the token and local database)
* Flickr API key (free)

## Setup on Synology
--------------------
Might work on other platforms like Windows also.
*Side note:* don't be overwhelmed with this setup. They are quite
straitghtforward.

Enable and access your Synology DSM via SSH with an admin user.
Avoid the use of root for security reasons

## Configuration
----------------
Go to http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply and apply for an API
key Edit the following variables in the uploadr.ini

* FILES_DIR = "YourDir"
* FLICKR = {
        "title"                 : "",
        "description"           : "",
        "tags"                  : "auto-upload",
        "is_public"             : "0",
        "is_friend"             : "0",
        "is_family"             : "0",
        "api_key"               : "Yourkey",
        "secret"                : "YourSecret"
        }
* FLICKR["api_key"] = ""
* FLICKR["secret"] = ""
* EXCLUDED_FOLDERS = ["@eaDir","#recycle"]
* IGNORED_REGEX = ['*[Ii][Gg][Nn][Oo][Rr][Ee]*', 'Private*']
* ALLOWED_EXT = ["jpg","png","avi","mov","mpg","mp4","3gp"]
* MANAGE_CHANGES = True
* FULL_SET_NAME = False

Refer to https://www.flickr.com/services/api/upload.api.html for what each
of the upload arguments above correspond to for Flickr's API.

- Before running uploadr.py make sure you run the command below:
  - To avoid running this command exerytime you log-in into your system, follow the [notes on this link](https://scipher.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/setting-your-pythonpath-environment-variable-linuxunixosx/) to edit file ~/.bashrc and place this command there.
```bash
 $  export PYTHONPATH=~/apps/Python/lib/python2.7/site-packages
 $ ./uploadr.py -v
```
 
## Usage/Arguments/Options
--------------------------
Place the file uploadr.py in any directory and run via ssh
(execution privs required).
It will crawl through all the files from the FILES_DIR directory and begin
the upload process.
```bash
$ ./uploadr.py
```
To check what files uploadr.py would upload and delete you can run the
script withe option --dry-run:
```bash
$ ./uploadr.py --dry-run
```
Run ./uploadrd.py --help for up to the minute information or arguments:
```bash
$ ./uploadr.py --help

usage: uploadr.py [-h] [-v] [-n] [-i TITLE] [-e DESCRIPTION] [-t TAGS] [-r]
                  [-p P] [-g] [-l N] [-d] [-b]

Upload files to Flickr. Uses uploadr.ini as config file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Provides some more verbose output. Will provide
                        progress information on upload. See also LOGGING_LEVEL
                        value in INI file.
  -n, --dry-run         Dry run
  -i TITLE, --title TITLE
                        Title for uploaded files. Overwrites title from INI
                        config file. If not indicated and not defined in INI
                        file, it uses filename as title.
  -e DESCRIPTION, --description DESCRIPTION
                        Description for uploaded filesOverwrites description
                        from INI config file.
  -t TAGS, --tags TAGS  Space-separated tags for uploaded files.It appends to
                        the tags defined in INI file.
  -r, --drip-feed       Wait a bit between uploading individual files
  -p P, --processes P   Number of photos to upload simultaneously.
  -g, --remove-ignored  Remove previously uploaded files, that are now being
                        ignored due to change of the INI file configuration
                        EXCLUDED_FOLDERS
  -l N, --list-photos-not-in-set N
                        List as many as N photos not in set. Maximum listed
                        photos is 500.
  -d, --daemon          Run forever as a daemon.Uploading every SLEEP_TIME
                        secondsPlease note it only performs upload/replace
  -b, --bad-files       Save on database bad files to prevent continuous
                        uploading attempts. Bad files are files in your
                        Library that flickr does not recognize (Error 5).
  -w, --walk-files-only Scan files to populate database
  -f  --fast-upload     Disable walk files to upload directly
```

## Task Scheduler (cron)
------------------------
Optionally run with crontab/Task Scheduler (Synology/Control Panel)
- Use  upload.cron added to the distribution and adapt to your needs.

```bash
cron entry (runs at the top of every hour)
0  *  *  *  * /full/path/to/uploadr.cron > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Q&A
------
* Q: Who is this script designed for?
* A: Those people comfortable with the command line that want to backup their media on Flickr in full resolution.

* Q: Why don't you use OAuth?
* A: I do! As of November 2017

* Q: Are you a python ninja?
* A: No, sorry. I just picked up the language to write this script because python can easily be installed on a Synology Diskstation.

* Q: Is this script feature complete and fully tested?
* A: Nope. It's a work in progress. I've tested it as needed for my needs, but it's possible to build additional features by contributing to the script.

* Q: How to automate it with a Synology NAS ?
* A: First you will need to run script at least one time in a ssh client to get the token file.
     Refer to the "Task Scheduler (cron)" section above.
     Then with DSM 6.1, create an automate task, make it run once a day for example, and put this in the textbox without quotes "path_to_your_python_program path_to_your_script". For example, assuming you installed Python package from Synocommunity, command should look like "/usr/local/python/bin/python /volume1/script/flickr-uploader/uploadr.py".
